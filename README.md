NASA APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day)

Overview

This website is capstone project for "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" Udemy course to learn how to build a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client.
I chose the NASA APOD, Astronomy Picture of the Day, API because of the extraordinary pictures I can display. This site displays the currect picture of the day as the default and excepts a date as 
input to view "prior pictures of the day".


Installation Instructions

1. Run npm i to install the dependent software packages.
2. Create the environment file .env and add your NASA API KEY: NASA_API_KEY=<apiKey>.
3. Run: nodemon index.js
